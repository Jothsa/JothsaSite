Huyang is so funny
~~Can someone please fix Hera's lekku. They look like hard plastic.~~ They actually look looks similar in *Rebels*. I would prefer a 
Ahoksa's montrails look great. Just a bit too flexible imo. Notice this when she runs especially.
Mon Mothma! I love her actress!
Jacen's hair is ugggly
Shin is so Old Republic. I really hope we can see an Old Republic movie. That timeline is so ripe with opportunity. I would love to see a SWTOR movie adaptation.
Ahsoka's spacesuit lol.
This scene is pretty goofy ngl
Yoooo purgill
I hope the New Republic takes action
Stranded? Ugh.
Will we see a forest saber fight before they can escape?
Was hoping the episode would be longer
If/When the ring jumps, it's going to look so cool
Loooorrre
Hunt them youself Baylan. I guess it's too soon for that fight
The credits are so cool
The music, the violins, chef's kiss
