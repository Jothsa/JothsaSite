A few years before the Second Herrscher Eruption, Welt and Dr. Lieserl Albert Einstein went after a Schicksal convoy based on intel that said it was carrying a “Herrscher Killer”. Welt attacked the truck, picking it up and spilling out the Valkyries carried within. One of these valkyries was Cecilia Schariac. He obtained a small black cube from within the truck, which was apparently the weapon. However, there was nothing within. They’d been misled. The Valkyries attacked Welt, but he stopped their attacks with ease, launching Cecilia away. He then discovered that Cecilia’s blood burned him, and said that he needed to find her. The next day, Welt spotted Cecilia with Siegfried Kaslana.

When Siegfried and Cecilia were separated briefly, Einstein and Welt took the opportunity to capture Cecilia. Siegfried heard there was a “gas attack” at the arcade, and he rushed to help Cecilia, only to be stopped by Welt. He pointed a gun at Siegfried and said he won’t hurt either of them if Siegfried walks away. Siegfried, thinking Welt is a Schicksal agent sent to take her back, rushes Welt, who uses his Herrscher powers to increase Siegfried’s weight by 10x. After attempting to attack Welt, Siegfried collapsed.

During the Second Eruption, Welt, Einstein, and Tesla were monitoring the area. Welt saw Siegfried below and said to the others that he needed to keep him on their side. Before Squad Snowwolf was overrun by Honkai Beasts, Welt descends from the sky and forces the squad to kneel with the Star of Eden. He then uses “Cognitive De-structuring” to destroy the Honkai beasts in the area. He approaches the squad, stating he means no harm, and that they should set aside their differences to deal with the entity in the tower. When Siegfried tells him to get lost, Welt recounts the Kaslana oath and earns his trust, which leads Siegfried to exercise his power as field officer and make an alliance.

Inside the tower, Welt attempted to locate Sirin with his powers, but said that she left via a “spacial rift”.

Welt, Theresa Apocalypse, and Siegfried located Sirin, who was inside what Welt called a “Honkai Chrysalis”.

When Siegfried is overrun by the Son of Dawn and Son of Darkness within, Welt immediately destroys them both. He explains to Siegfried that the 2nd Herrscher controls the void itself, and that she created an imaginary space, in which Theresa was contained. He ripped it open.

Telling Siegfried to grab Theresa and run, Welt attempts to fight Sirin. Sirin tries to impale Siegfried, but Welt stops her Subspace Lance. He introduces himself as Welt, the 1st Herrscher. Sirin is informed of the Honkai “traitor” (that being Welt). Welt attacks Sirin using a “barrage of reason”, however he notices that it’s stopped by what he called an “imaginary void barrier”. While he thinks she’s distracted, Welt comes in from behind, only to fall into her trap. Welt is promptly swallowed by Benares.

However, this doesn’t kill him. Welt simply pries open Benares’ maw and walks out, challenging Sirin to a second round. When Benares tries to get up and eat him again, Welt simply drops (what I assume to be a giant mech) on it. Welt summons dozens of mechs, as well as other dozens that were hidden. They all fire on Sirin, even managing to crack her void shield. Welt summons even more troops, including missile barrages and dozens of warships. They all fire on Sirin. However, Sirin redirects these attacks and destroys all his mechs. Sirin grabs Welt, but Welt is smiling. This is because a nuke is on its way, right behind Sirin. However, it doesn’t manage to kill her, only severely weaken her.

Welt summons a fake Star of Eden, and starts sucking Sirin into a black hole. However, right before Welt can finish her off, a clown appears and delivers a punch to Welt’s gut, forcing him to his knees. This interrupts his focus, letting Sirin escape. When the clown is about to kill him, Welt is saved by Siegfried. Being carried back to the Tower of Babylon, Einstein and Tesla set up a medical bay for him.

When Sirin demanded for Welt to meet her at the moon, Welt obliged after figuring out that the lunar chunks she sent down had traces of Soulium.

Welt set up a meeting with Otto, where the first thing Otto did was subtly mention Welt Joyce’s death. Despite his anger, Welt composes himself and explains his plan to Otto, requesting that Siegfried would join him on his trip to the moon. Otto agrees. Welt goes to Siegfried and informs him that he will be going to the moon with him. They go to the AE Yellowstone base, where their “rocket” (a giant Arahato mech) is. Welt reveals that he invented Arahato as funding for AE. Welt provides two options to Siegfried for this mission. One involves Siegfried taking the Soulium samples and leaving him behind on the moon. Welt says it is Siegfried's choice whether to do so or not.

Before Welt launches, he says his goodbyes to Tesla and Einstein. Tesla reminds him that when he was a child, he had always wanted to dance with her. Tesla finally fulfills this wish.

That evening they launch. Along the flight, he and Siegfried bond and become close friends with each other. The two of them land on the moon, and Welt walks out on his own. Bella greets Welt, and leads him towards Sirin. Sirin promises forgiveness to Welt if he bows before her. He refuses. In order to lead Sirin and Bella away from the Palace of Selene, Welt flies off into space with them hot on his tail. When Welt gets himself trapped by Sirin’s void hands, Welt activates a quasi black hole from the Star of Eden. The time distortion of the black hole gives Siegfried plenty of time to collect Soulium and launch back to earth.

When Sirin goes against her word and launches more lunar meteors towards the earth, Welt is forced to stop her by creating more mechs and barrages. When he destroys all of them, he falls down, allowing Sirin to approach. When she tries to finish him off, Welt grabs her and attempts to detonate both of their Cores (something he learned from Dr. Tesla). Sirin quickly rips the Core out of him, stopping this attempt. Knowing he’d have to resort to plan B, Welt fakes his death by deconstructing his body and hiding his soul inside of the Core of Reason, which Sirin consumes.

Sirin arrives on Earth and causes immense destruction. She uses the Fenghuang Down she managed to obtain to capture Cecilia and Siegfried and trap them in a fake world. To her chagrin, the couple lives in a peaceful world without Honkai, rather than in a nightmare. By some accident, Sirin is also caught in the illusion, and experiences life as their daughter and Kiana's sister. Welt begins to resurface and interfere in the illusion to snap Seigfried out of it but fails. Bella's death in reality triggers Sirin to awaken and attack the couple, but Welt protects them and allows them to escape.

Once everyone escapes the illusion, Sirin again goes on a destructive rampage, and crushes the Core of Reason in rage. Welt managed to upload himself into the Selene prototype on the Arahato mech's chest. Siegfried's Metamorph Ichor activation is enough to nearly defeat Sirin. The Core of the Void overloads, and Welt protects Siegfried and Cecilia with a force field from the Selene mechanism.
