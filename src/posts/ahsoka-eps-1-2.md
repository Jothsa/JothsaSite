## Episode One

Aaahhhh! Star Wars is back! Rosario is a great Ahsoka. Sabine is a little annoying. Lightsabers!!! The ending credits are cool. I hope Ezra isn't annoying. Hera is cool, but a little off in live action imo (not the actress's fault of course, she's great). Loth cat! Baylan's apprentice seems very Old Republic to me. I should really free up enough space on my computer so I can play SWTOR again. ~~support my computer fund on KoFi~~ Why/How would Ahsoka train Sabine if she's not force sensitive?

## Episode Two

Seeing Ahsoka use psychometry is really cool. (Why does the code spell check plugin I use in vscode have "psychometry" as a valid word but not "fullscreen" or "lightsaber?" )
